# Awesome Advanced SVM Cohort Project Collection

This repository serves as a curated collection of projects created by participants of the Advanced SVM Cohort, a program focused on building applications using the Solana SVM (Scalable Virtual Machine) API. These projects were either fully developed during the cohort or started during the cohort and expanded afterward. Each entry links to the student's GitHub repository.


## Project List

- **Rust solana client extension:**
  - **Description**: A solana rust client extension crate can be used to simulate transactions locally using the SVM api.
  - **Status**: Completed during cohort.
  - **Demo**: [Link to live demo if available]
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Rust.

- **Based Rollup:**
  - **Description**: A single-app SVM rollup using Solana’s SVM API that offloads and batches transactions off-chain, sequences and executes them with account locking and local state updates, delegates authority over the user funds during the process of batching and processing txs, then settles bundled batches (e.g., 10 tx) back on-chain to boost throughput and reduce fees without sacrificing Solana security, returns funds that are left to the user.

  - **Status**: Completed during ADV-SVM Q1 2025 cohort.
  - **Tech Stack**: Rust, Solana SVM API, Actix Web (frontend HTTP server to send transactions through it), Crossbeam and async channels (concurrency), In-memory DB (rollup state), Anchor (Solana program for the delegation of funds during the process), Solana RPC

- **Custom Syscall:**
  - **Description**: A simple implementation of custom syscall. 
  - **Status**: Completed during cohort.
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Solana SDK, Rust.

- **Kym0211-Custom Sysvar:**
  - **Description**: A simple implementation of custom sysvar. 
  - **Status**: Completed during cohort.
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Solana SDK, Rust.

- **ZKSVM Rollup:**
  - **Description**: A general-purpose zero-knowledge rollup built on Solana's SVM for generating and verifying cryptographic proofs on-chain. Research-focused implementation for benchmarking SNARKs on SVM.
  - **Status**: In Progress - Core architecture discussed, ZK proof generation in development.
  - **Demo**: Demo will be available once zero-knowledge proof generation and verification features are completed.
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Solana SDK, Rust, Actix Web, Groth16-Solana, Ark-ff, BN254.

- **Agave Custom Syscall:**
  - **Description**: A demonstration to build a custom syscall that returns Base-58 of a pubkey.
  - **Status**: Completed during cohort.
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Solana SDK, Rust, Typescript.

- **zkSVM rollup using SP1 zkVM:**
  - **Description**: A zkSVM rollup built on the SP1 zkVM provided by Succinct.
  - **Status**: Completed during cohort.
  - **Tech Stack**: Solana SVM API, Solana SDK, SP1 zkVM, Rust, Typescript.
  - **Implemented By**: [Dodecahedr0x](https://github.com/Dodecahedr0x), [Stanislav](https://github.com/LStan) and [The Wuh](https://github.com/thewuhxyz)

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to add your project as a Git submodule! This allows the code to be included directly in this collection while linking back to your original repo.

To add or update a project:
1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/Turbin3/ADV-Runtime.git`.
3. Add your project as a submodule:
   - Run `git submodule add <your-repo-url> <submodule-path>`.
   - Example: `git submodule add https://github.com/student/rollup student-rollup`.
   - Choose a clear path like `yourusername-projectname`.
4. Update the `README.md` file to include your project details in the **Project List** section, following the format above (include the submodule path).
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "Add submodule and README entry for my project"`.
6. Push to your fork: `git push`.
7. Submit a pull request to the main repository with a clear description of your addition.
8. Ensure your original repository is public (or grant access to the cohort organizer if private).

**Note**: Submodules point to specific commits in your repo. If you update your project later, you can submit another PR to update the submodule pointer.
